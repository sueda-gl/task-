### **Scene 2: Parameter Control (45 seconds)**
1. **Adjust Face Price slider**: Move from $100 to $150
   - *"Watch how the entire system recalculates in real-time"*
2. **Change Inventory**: Set to 150 units
   - *"The optimization algorithms handle different inventory constraints dynamically"*
3. **Modify Customers**: Set to 200
   - *"We can scale from 50 to 300 customers efficiently"*

### **Scene 3: Stage 1 Analysis (60 seconds)**
1. **Point to bucket visualization**: 
   - *"This shows our innovative bucket-based allocation across 10 pricing segments"*
   - *"Green bars show accepted customers, demonstrating the algorithm's selectivity"*

## üîß **If Technical Questions Arise**

**Q: "How does the MILP solver work?"**
*A: "We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program with binary customer selection variables and continuous price variables, solved using the CBC optimizer for guaranteed optimal solutions."*

**Q: "What about computational complexity?"**
*A: "The bucket allocation runs in O(n log n) time, while the MILP stage scales polynomially with customer count. For 300 customers, we get solutions in under a second."*

**Q: "How do you ensure fairness?"**
*A: "We track fairness ratios comparing served vs unserved customer bid distributions, plus economic efficiency metrics to ensure we're not just serving high-bid customers."*
